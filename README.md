# BookScraper
 The SRC code for my mini Bookscraper project I coded.
 Here, I scrapped a website (https://books.toscrape.com).
 This program scrapes the genres that are availible in the site. Moreover, it can list the books based on the user's preferred genre and that chosen book's info, cost etc. It only uses the python language and uses crucial modules like BeautifulSoup for the main scraping and as well as Selenium for the navigation of one page to another.
